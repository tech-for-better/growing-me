- Independent debugging, tracing code paths and being OK with imperfection.
- A thorough understanding of state management pitfalls and coping strategies.
- React hooks - useReducer, useRef, useContext and many more! As well as custom hooks.
- Prioritisation and negotiation with a product owner.

# Additional Features

There were a few features we were unable to incorporate into the MVP due to time constraints. ‚è≥ These included:

- Add and delete multiple growing items to the Me Tree.
- Account setting features like change password, delete user account, and adding multiple children to one account.
- Use the Me Tree as an avatar throughout the app.
- "Lock" later content in the activities section until previous activities are complete.
